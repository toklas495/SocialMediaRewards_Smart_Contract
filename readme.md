# SocialMediaRewards Smart Contract

## Project Description
The **SocialMediaRewards** smart contract is a decentralized application that allows users to complete tasks and earn tokens. The platform uses a custom ERC-20 token called **SocialMediaToken (SMT)** to reward users for completing tasks. Additionally, admins can issue **NFT badges** for users who achieve significant milestones. The contract also supports token transfers between users, allowing for a dynamic and engaging rewards system.

## Key Features
- **Task Management**: Users can complete various tasks to earn SMT tokens.
- **Reward System**: Users are rewarded with SMT tokens upon completing tasks, and the total supply is updated accordingly.
- **NFT Badges**: Admins can award unique NFT badges to users for achieving milestones or completing significant tasks.
- **Custom Token (SMT)**: A custom ERC-20 token, SocialMediaToken (SMT), is used as a reward for tasks.
- **Token Transfer**: Users can transfer their earned SMT tokens to other addresses.
- **Admin Controls**: Only admins can add tasks and award badges.

## Contract Address
The contract is deployed at the following Ethereum address:0x351bc0059b82aa81775f74Fc09Ce2512779818a4

## Future Improvements
- **Staking**: Implement staking features where users can stake SMT tokens to earn additional rewards or benefits.
- **Dynamic Reward System**: Introduce a dynamic reward system where tasks have variable rewards based on difficulty or time.
- **Advanced Badge System**: Add tiered badges with more complex criteria for awarding, such as badges for completing multiple tasks in a row or achieving certain activity levels.
- **Governance**: Introduce governance features where token holders can vote on new features, tasks, or changes to the system.
- **Integration with Decentralized Finance (DeFi)**: Integrate the platform with DeFi protocols for more utility of SMT tokens, such as liquidity pools or yield farming.
- **Multi-Admin Support**: Allow for more than one admin to manage tasks and badges, providing a more decentralized management system.
